## Diagnosis

### Medical History and Physical Examination
- Doctors evaluate symptoms like irregular periods, excess hair growth, and acne.
- Physical exams may include checking blood pressure, BMI, and signs of excess hair growth.

### Pelvic Examination
- A pelvic exam is performed to check for any abnormalities in the reproductive organs.

### Blood Tests
- Hormone levels such as testosterone, estrogen, LH, insulin, and anti-müllerian hormone are measured.
- Blood tests help identify hormonal imbalances associated with PCOS.

### Ultrasound
- An ultrasound is used to visualize the ovaries and the thickness of the uterine lining.
- Polycystic ovaries and other structural abnormalities can be detected through ultrasound imaging.

## Treatment

### Lifestyle Changes
- Diet and exercise play a crucial role in managing PCOS symptoms.
- Weight management can help improve insulin sensitivity and regulate hormone levels.

### Medications
- Medications may be prescribed to induce ovulation in women trying to conceive.
- Drugs to manage insulin resistance and high androgen levels are commonly used.

### Symptom Management
- Treatment options for acne, excessive hair growth, and other symptoms are available.
- Birth control pills may be recommended to regulate menstrual cycles and reduce androgen levels.

## Individualized Care
- Treatment plans are tailored to each individual based on age, symptom severity, and fertility goals.
- Regular monitoring and adjustments to the treatment plan may be necessary for optimal management of PCOS.
# PCOS Dataset Cleaning and Preprocessing

This document outlines the data cleaning and preprocessing steps performed on a PCOS dataset, including the removal of unnecessary columns and handling of missing values.

## Dataset Attributes

The dataset contains the following attributes:

1. **PCOS (Y/N)** - Yes (Y) or No (N) indicates presence of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, a hormonal imbalance affecting ovulation and menstruation.

### Personal Information

2. **Age (yrs)** - Your current age in years.
3. **BMI** - Body Mass Index, a measure of weight relative to height, used to screen for potential weight-related health problems.

### Medical Information

4. **Blood Group** - A, B, AB, or O blood type, a genetic classification of your blood based on surface molecules.
5. **Pulse rate(bpm)** - The number of times your heart beats per minute, an indicator of heart function.
6. **RR (breaths/min)** - Respiratory Rate, the number of breaths you take per minute, an indicator of respiratory function.
7. **Hb(g/dl)** - Hemoglobin concentration in your blood, carrying oxygen to your tissues. Lower levels may indicate anemia.

### Menstrual Cycle

8. **Cycle(R/I)** - Regular (R) or Irregular (I) menstrual cycle.
9. **Cycle length(days)** - Average number of days in your menstrual cycle, important for tracking ovulation and fertility.

### Pregnancy and Fertility

10. **Pregnant(Y/N)** - Yes (Y) or No (N) indicating pregnancy status.
11. **No. of abortions** - Number of prior pregnancy terminations, which may influence future fertility.
12. **I beta-HCG(mIU/mL)** - Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level in the first trimester of pregnancy, a hormone produced by the developing placenta.
13. **II beta-HCG(mIU/mL)** - Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level in the second trimester of pregnancy, used to monitor fetal development.

### Hormone Levels

14. **FSH(mIU/mL)** - Follicle Stimulating Hormone level, a hormone involved in egg maturation.
15. **LH(mIU/mL)** - Luteinizing Hormone level, a hormone involved in ovulation and egg release.
16. **FSH/LH** - Ratio of FSH to LH levels, which can indicate ovulation problems.
17. **Waist:Hip Ratio** - Ratio of your waist circumference to hip circumference, a body fat distribution measure.
18. **TSH (mIU/L)** - Thyroid Stimulating Hormone level, a hormone regulating your thyroid function and metabolism.
19. **AMH(ng/mL)** - Anti-Müllerian Hormone level, an indicator of remaining eggs in your ovaries and potential fertility.
20. **PRL(ng/mL)** - Prolactin level, a hormone involved in milk production and can affect ovulation.
21. **Vit D3 (ng/mL)** - Vitamin D3 level, important for bone health and may influence fertility.
22. **PRG(ng/mL)** - Progesterone level, a hormone involved in preparing the uterus for pregnancy.

### Blood Sugar and Weight

23. **RBS(mg/dl)** - Random Blood Sugar level, a snapshot of your blood sugar at a particular time.
24. **Weight gain(Y/N)** - Yes (Y) or No (N) indicating recent weight gain, which can affect hormone levels and fertility.

### Symptoms

25. **hair growth(Y/N)** - Yes (Y) or No (N) indicating excessive hair growth, a potential symptom of PCOS.
26. **Skin darkening (Y/N)** - Yes (Y) or No (N) indicating skin darkening, a potential symptom of hormonal imbalance.
27. **Hair loss(Y/N)** - Yes (Y) or No (N) indicating hair loss, which can be caused by hormonal imbalances.
28. **Pimples(Y/N)** - Yes (Y) or No (N) indicating presence of pimples, a potential symptom of hormonal imbalance.

### Lifestyle

29. **Fast food (Y/N)** - Yes (Y) or No (N) indicating frequent fast food consumption, which can affect hormone regulation.
30. **Reg.Exercise(Y/N)** - Yes (Y) or No (N) indicating regular exercise routine, which can improve hormonal health.

### Ovary and Uterine Health

31. **BP _Systolic (mmHg)** - Systolic blood pressure reading, the top number indicating pressure when your heart beats.
32. **BP _Diastolic (mmHg)** - Diastolic blood pressure reading, the bottom number indicating pressure between heartbeats.
33. **Follicle No. (L)** - Number of follicles on the left ovary, small fluid-filled sacs containing eggs.
34. **Follicle No. (R)** - Number of follicles on the right ovary.
35. **Avg. F size (L) (mm)** - Average size of follicles on the left ovary in millimeters, used to monitor egg development.
36. **Avg. F size (R) (mm)** - Average size of follicles on the right ovary in millimeters, used to monitor egg development.
37. **Endometrium (mm)** - Thickness of the uterine lining in millimeters, which prepares for pregnancy and sheds during menstruation.

## Checking for Missing Values

The dataset was checked for missing values, and further processing steps were taken as necessary.
